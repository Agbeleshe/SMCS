The aim of a Student Counseling Management System (SCMS) is to provide an integrated and efficient platform that supports the delivery of comprehensive counseling services to students within an educational institution.
The main objectives of the Student Counseling Management System are as follows:


1. To create a user-friendly and centralized platform that facilitates efficient communication between students and counselors.
2. To automate the appointment scheduling process, ensuring that the students can easily book counseling sessions at their convenience.
3. To provide counselors with a comprehensive overview of each studentâ€™s counseling history and progress, enabling more personalized support and guidance.
4. To show students grade developments so as to determine if a student is not in the usual performance level.
